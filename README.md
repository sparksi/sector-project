# Sector's Composer Project Template

[Sector](https://www.sector.org.nz/) is a Drupal 9 distribution (or install profile) built and maintained by [Sparks Interactive](https://www.sparksinteractive.co.nz).

## Installation

This repository is for inclusion as part of a `composer create-project` installation only.

Complete installation instructions are available at the main Sector repository: https://github.com/sparksi/sector-distribution.

### Quick Start

Composer will create a new directory called `{project-name}` containing a `web` directory with a complete Drupal 9 codebase and the Sector install profile.

    composer create-project sparksinteractive/sector-project {project-name}

## What Does This Template Do?

When installing the given `composer.json` some tasks are taken care of:

* Drupal core will be installed in the `web/core` directory.
* Modules (packages of type `drupal-module`), themes (packages of type `drupal-theme`), and profiles (packages of type `drupal-profile`) are automatically installed to their respective `web/(modules|themes|profiles)/contrib` directories.
* The latest version of Drush is installed locally for use at `./vendor/bin/drush`.
